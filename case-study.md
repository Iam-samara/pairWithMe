# Case Study

Setup and folder structure


Setting up a React project based on components takes a little bit of time to map out what components you need and where.

Home Page Mock ![Home Page](assets/wireframes/home-page.png "Home Page")

Add Profile Page Mock ![Add Profile Page](assets/wireframes/add-profile-page.png "Add Profile Page")

Guide Page Mock ![Guide Page](assets/wireframes/guide-page.png "Guide Page")

Individual Project Page Mock ![Individual Project Page](assets/wireframes/individual-project-page.png "Individual Project Page")

Recent Projects Page ![Recent Projects Page](assets/wireframes/recent-projects-page.png "Recent Projects Page")

View Profile Page Mock ![View Profile Page](assets/wireframes/view-profile-page.png "View Profile Page")

Search Page Mock![Search Page](assets/wireframes/search-page.png "Search Page")

Based on the wireframes above we decided we need the following components for our React App

- Header
  - LoginStatus
- HomeHero
- FinishedProjects
- Footer
- Profile
- UserData
  - Form
- UserInfo
  - UserProjects
- RecentProjects
- IndividualProjects
  - UserReports
- Guide
  - HowTo
  - Resources
- SearchForm
  - SearchResults
  - Users
